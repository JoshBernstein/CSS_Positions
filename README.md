# CSS Positioning

This assignment is broken into two parts. After doing this assignment, you should have an understanding of:

- The use of `position` and related CSS properties

## Part 1: Positioning Basics

In the first part we'll just play around with some basic positioning rules to ensure that we understand the fundamentals.

The goal is to make your final version look like mine:

### Tasks

1. Make all the positioning for the boxes relative to the div with class `container`
<!-- 
.container{
  position: absolute;
} 
.box{
  position: absolute
}
-->
2. Set the position of the `.blue` box to be `50px` down and `200px` to the right of it's static (original) position
3. Position the `.red` box absolutely `50px` from the top and `100px` from the right of its container
4. Position the `.green` box absolutely `50px` from the bottom and `50%` from the right of its container
5. Position the `.orange` box absolutely `75%` from the top and `25%` from the left of its container
6. Fix the `.yellow` box to the bottom of the window. Make sure it starts at the left side and spans the entire width of the page, and that it stays there when you scroll the page.
7. Ensure that the blue box remains on top of all of the other boxes (this is where `z-index` comes in!)

## Part 2: Positioning in Practice

In this part, you'll be creating film cards with actions that should be specifically positioned. This will require you to use the display and float skills you learned, as well as the `position` property from today.

### Tasks

Here's the final version you're trying to recreate:

The plan is to make yours look as close to the final version as possible. The key features are:

- The watch later (clock) icon is positioned at the top right of the poster
  - I set mine `8px` down and `8px` from the right, but you can choose whatever looks best to you!
- The action icons (bookmark, heart and star) are positioned at the bottom right of the card
  - I set mine `8px` up and `8px` from the right, but you can choose whatever looks best to you!
